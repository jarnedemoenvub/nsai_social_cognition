- integrate multiple faces and pass them to the emotion recognizer.
Possible by creating a new dataset where we extract the faces from the image, link it to the original image and when we call the image for inference or training, we get the corresponding faces (tensor, same way as we made tensors for the emotion and scene) and pass them to the emotion recognizer.
Only take into account emotions with high confidence (>0.5) and average the emotions if multiple faces are detected. That average emotion can be used to determine the social context together with the scene confidences.

Combine prob distr over emotion and scenes together as input and output the label (emotion) with a neural net. Later on we can incoorporate logic rules to refine the output.
